function [Interaction,kCompound,kTarget,Did,Tid]=getdata(path,dataset)
%getdata loads the the interaction information of a particular dataset
%along with the pairwise similarities between the involved drugs and
%targets
%
% [Interaction,kCompound,kTarget,Did,Tid] = getdata(path,dataset)
%
% INPUT
%  path:        the path where all the files to be loaded are
%  dataset:     the dataset of interest ('nr', 'gpcr', 'ic' or 'e')
%
% OUTPUT
%  Interaction: the interaction matrix (target rows, drug columns)
%  kCompound:   pairwise similarities between drugs
%  kTarget:     pairwise similarities between targets
%  Did:         KEGG IDs of drugs
%  Tid:         KEGG IDs of targets

    % Now, 'Interaction' has the matrix WITHOUT the column headers and

    % NOTE: The top-left-most cell in the extracted adjacency matrix 
    % is 'empty'

    % The uppermost row of the extracted adjacency matrix contains the 
    % column headers (drugs' IDs)

    %matrix becomes positive semi-definite:

    %We had problems with kCompound having imaginary eigenvalues. Here, we symmetrize kCompound
    %before continuing:
    kCompound = (kCompound + kCompound')/2;

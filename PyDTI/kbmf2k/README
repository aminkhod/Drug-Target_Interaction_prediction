This repository contains Matlab and R implementations of the algorithms proposed in "Kernelized Bayesian Matrix Factorization", which is appearing in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and the Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013).

demo.m performs regression on the toy data set described in the manuscripts.
demo.R performs regression on the toy data set described in the manuscripts.
